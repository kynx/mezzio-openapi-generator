# TODO

* [ ] User-supplied type -> class mapping that returns a `ClassString`. Also simplifies our logic mapping these - no more `PropertyType::isClass()`
* [ ] Routing: allow specification extension to add middleware to operation
* [ ] Routing: middleware to inject `Operation` into route. Allows guard middleware added above to consume operation
* [ ] Test generation. See https://packagist.org/packages/canvural/php-openapi-faker
